This repository will be used mostly to tinker around with the functions of this interface. New stuff to me.
I'll be gathering Information for school
I am currently unsure of what sort of project this will become.
I'm imagining it'll be used for my own benefit.
It'll be related to social media and family lineage.
My changes are based on this data science project for school.
